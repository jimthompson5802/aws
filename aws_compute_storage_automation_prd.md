# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Title
AWS Compute and Storage Automation Script

## Objective
Develop a Python script to automate the provisioning of AWS EC2 instances and associated storage volumes based on a predefined specification.

## Background
Manual setup of compute and storage resources in AWS is time-consuming and error-prone. Automating this process will improve efficiency, consistency, and scalability.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Input Specification**
   - The script must accept a predefined specification in **YAML** format describing:
     - One or more EC2 instances: type, AMI, key pair, security groups, subnet, tags, etc.
     - Instance market type: support both **on-demand and spot instances**.
     - Storage volumes: size, type, device mapping, IOPS, encrypted, etc.

2. **Resource Provisioning**
   - Create one or more EC2 instance(s) as per the specification.
   - Attach EBS volumes as specified.
   - Tag resources appropriately.

3. **Idempotency**
   - Running the script multiple times with the same specification should not create duplicate resources.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Provide clear error messages for failed operations.
   - Roll back resources if provisioning fails partway.

5. **Logging**
   - Log all actions and outcomes for auditability.

6. **Resource Deletion**
   - The script should support deletion/teardown of resources as specified.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Use boto3 (AWS SDK for Python).
- Script should be runnable from the command line.
- Support for at least one AWS region, defaulting to **us-east** (configurable).
- Documentation for usage and input specification.
- Assume AWS credentials are provided via **environment variables**.

## Out of Scope
- Configuration of software inside the EC2 instance.
- Management of resources outside EC2 and EBS (e.g., RDS, S3).

## Deliverables
- Python script(s)
- Example YAML input specification file
- Documentation (README)

## Open Questions
- None (all clarified).
7. Should the script assume AWS credentials are already configured, or handle credential setup?

Please clarify these points to proceed with a detailed design and implementation plan.
